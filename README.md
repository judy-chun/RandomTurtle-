# RandomTurtle-
Programming a turtle taking a random walk through its world. The turtle will take a 1-dimensional random walk, moving from the bottom to the top of the screen, randomly moving either a bit to the left or bit to the right with each "step" upward. The turtle will take a random walk and calculate its displacement, and counting steps given displacement.
